## Introduction
The project will involve investigating the following dataset:
The Ames Iowa housing dataset.

  The main question of interest in this dataset is How do home features add up to its price tag? This analysis involves forming a predictive model for the response variable, SalePrice, as a function of the 79 predictor variables. The 79 predictor variables are described in the file data description.txt.
